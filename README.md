Query the Octopus Energy API for products, services & consumption and ingest into Splunk for visualisation.

## Description

This project came to fruition after reading the below article:

I went from being happy with my IHD Smart Meter, to wondering if I could download my usage to wondering if I could query it in "real time".

Turns out you can.

## To Do List

This is a list of things I'd like this app to do.

 - Retrieve & display current tarrif
 - Retrieve & display current consumption (Electricity & Gas)
   - This hour
   - Today so far
   - This week so far
   - This month so far
   - Comparison This Time Last Month
   - Comparison This Time Last Year
 - Retrieve & display current unit prices (Electricity & Gas)
   - Cost this hour
   - Cost today so far
   - Cost this week so far
   - Cost this month so far
   - Comparison Spent This Time Last Month
   - Comparison Spent This Time Last Year

## Future Me's Problem

 - Retrieve & display other available tarrifs
 - Query the Agile API to retrieve forecasted half-hourly costs for the next day
